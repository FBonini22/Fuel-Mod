# Fuel-Mod
This is the code repository for a realistic fuel mod for GTA V. Cars come with fuel tanks as standard, and cars can lose that fuel if their tank is damaged. A car without fuel by default cannot be driven in GTA.

Why not use the built-in fuel tank and model realistic fuel consumption for in-game vehicles?

This mod includes:
-Realistic fuel consumption, based on several factors:
    -Speed
    -Engine RPM
    
-Ability to refuel at ALL in-game gas stations
    -You are charged per liter
    -Prices vary by gas station location
    
-Ability to refuel with a jerry can
